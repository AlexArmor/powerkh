    <p>
      When people say BIM is not necessary for their project, they mean that
      itâ€™s too complex for them. However, the right company can do the modeling
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But finding the right BIM company for your construction project can be
      difficult. To make the most out of BIM technology, you need to consider
      the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engineering qualifications. Experts with an engineering background will
        understand your designs and be able to transform your flat drawings into
        fully realized 3D models.
      </li>
      <li>
        Value for the money. Some companies may charge high prices, but you will
        spend less overall if design problems are identified and fixed as early
        as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Experience in design. The right provider will know how to resolve your
        problems and help you stay within your budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Legislative knowledge. Companies with legal experts on their team can
        ensure that your project adheres to local and governmental standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Track record. A company with relevant case studies is much more likely
        to help you improve your project.
      </li>
    </ul>
