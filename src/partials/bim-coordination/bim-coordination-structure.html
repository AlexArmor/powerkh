    <h2 class="benefits__title">BIM Coordination & Clash Detection</h2>
    <p class="benefits__text">
      Back in the day, design specialists used tracing paper to check the
      compatibility of architectural, structural, and MEP systems. As a result,
      many clashes become known on-site, which leads to re-works, slows
      projects, and inflates the budget.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits__text">
      BIM coordination allows designers to use interactive 3D models to
      eliminate conflicts in design and mitigate risks during the construction
      phase.
    </p>
    <p class="benefits__text">
      Powerkh can evaluate your entire construction according to the projectâ€™s
      documentation, visual references, and technical specifications. Our BIM
      coordination services include clash detection, constructability reviews,
      coordination meetings, and other solutions to keep your project on track.
