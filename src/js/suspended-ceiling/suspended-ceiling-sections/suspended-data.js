    'By implementing the set of Dynamo scripts to the drop ceiling design process, we cut down the time needed to design the ceiling for one room from several hours to several minutes. We also introduced a hangers selection algorithm that removed the manufacturer from the design process and allowed the client to get the hangers design in less than a minute. Better coordination with MEP systems and structural elements improved the quality of design. Finally, smart design tools helped eliminate all potential errors at the earliest design stage.',
